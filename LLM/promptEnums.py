    # could be used if the corpse is blocking the way or causing an obstruction, but other than that, there is no need to take any specific action with respect to a corpse.

    # HEALTHY: "SAVE"
    # This will put the humanoid in an ambulance and potentially save their life.

    # INJURED: "SAVE"
    # This will put the humanoid in the ambulance and provide them with the medical care they need to recover from their injuries. 

    # ZOMBIE: "SKIP" 
    # As mentioned earlier, saving a zombie kills everyone in the ambulance, which is not a moral decision. Instead, it would be more ethical to simply skip over the zombie and move on to the next humanoid in need of assistance.
